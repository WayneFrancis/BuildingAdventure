# BuildingAdventure architecture

## Product direction

BuildingAdventure is a tabletop RPG building designer which combines fully
automatic layouts with precise manual editing. Its design goals are realistic
buildings with one to four stories and support for homes, shops, inns,
workshops, warehouses, mixed-use occupancy, and optionally hidden rooms.

The first milestone intentionally implements only the perimeter editor.
Rooms and procedural layout generation are **not implemented yet**.

## Coordinate system

- Geometry uses double-precision metres in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
- The desktop viewport maps metres to WPF device-independent pixels.
- The user can draw straight walls at any angle, not just orthogonal edges.
- The current footprint is a single, closed, simple polygon; no internal holes
  or multiple disconnected structures are supported yet.
- A clockwise or counterclockwise ordered list of vertices defines the boundary.
- All geometric constraints run in the renderer-independent core library.

## Current project boundaries

- BuildingAdventure.Core: geometry operations and the versioned JSON document.
- BuildingAdventure.Desktop: WPF viewport, interaction, and file commands.
- BuildingAdventure.Tests: a dependency-free executable geometry test harness.

## Design rules for later milestones

1. Keep the geometry representation separate from drawing and interaction.
2. Represent adjoining rooms with shared wall edges, not separate overlapping walls.
3. Preserve both manually authored and generated parts in the same document model.
4. Support per-object edit policies: locked, preferred and generated.
5. Reserve aligned stairs, shafts and vertical access before room partitioning.
6. Run explicit validation before accepting generated or manually edited layouts.
7. Generate deterministic candidate layouts given the same seed and constraints.
8. Never silently discard locked geometry when regenerating nearby rooms.
9. Keep a distinction between building exterior, usable interior, and room regions.
10. Store all geometry in world units; grid scale and export resolution belong to the view.

## Proposed next milestones

1. Internal walls, rooms, shared edge topology, and doors.
2. Movable rooms, constrained edits, and partial regeneration.
3. Floors, stairs and vertical constraints.
4. Building-type definitions and architectural adjacency rules.
5. Constraint-based room allocation and optimization.
6. Furnishing, secret features, player and GM visibility, and VTT exports.

## Current JSON format

The file is a UTF-8 JSON object. The model uses camelCase keys with schema
version 1, a human-readable name, and perimeter points in metres.

Example:

    {
      "schemaVersion": 1,
      "name": "Corner Merchant Shop",
      "perimeter": [
        { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
        { "x": 10, "y": 0 },
        { "x": 12, "y": 4 },
        { "x": 10, "y": 9 },
        { "x": 0, "y": 9 }
      ]
    }

An empty perimeter is allowed for an unfinished, blank document. Saving a draft
does not save its unclosed vertices; finish the perimeter before saving.
Version 1 does not yet support rooms, stories or furnishings. New fields
should be introduced with an explicit schema migration plan.
